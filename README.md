# 缘起
2024年6月6日，摸鱼时逛知乎。发现有一个关于《摸鱼学导论》的问题。https://www.zhihu.com/question/448630016/answer/1773299036  同时看到了下面的回答。里面有一点很触动。作者拍了春天的景色，让大家也拍一下和朋友们分享。
所以我想，我是不是可以在github开一个项目，让大家通过issues展示自己上班的时候摸鱼正在干什么。分享一下彼此的快乐和忧愁。以上。

# Origin
On June 6, 2024, while procrastinating, I was browsing Zhihu. I came across a question about the "Introduction to Procrastination Studies." https://www.zhihu.com/question/448630016/answer/1773299036 At the same time, I saw the following answer. There was something very touching in it. The author took pictures of spring scenes and suggested everyone do the same and share them with friends.
So, I thought, why not start a project on GitHub where everyone can showcase what they're doing while procrastinating at work through issues? Share each other's joys and sorrows. Above.
